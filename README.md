The site is fully dynamic, responsive, and tightly integrated with the company's internal systems including the CRM and Subscription Management System.

💡 Key Features
🔗 Integration with CRM & Subscriptions
The website communicates directly with the internal CRM system to capture client data, handle inquiries, and link interactions with ongoing deals and service plans.
It also connects with the Subscription System, allowing users to view and manage their subscription plans online.

💳 Dynamic Package Selection & Pricing
Users can:

Browse available subscription packages and offers

View real-time pricing and benefits

Choose and subscribe to the most suitable plan

🛠️ Admin Control Panel (No Code Edits Required)
Built a secure, standalone admin panel that allows authorized users to:

Update plan prices

Add/remove offers

Control package features
→ All of this without touching a single line of code.

🧩 Full Custom Development

Designed and implemented both frontend (UI/UX) and backend (APIs, DB) from scratch
